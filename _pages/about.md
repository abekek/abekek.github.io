Glad you visited my page! My name is Alibek Kaliyev, and I am an international student from Kazakhstan studying <b>Computer Science and Business at Lehigh University.
Along with my passion for Machine/Deep Learning technologies and Software Engineering, I am trying to combine them, I am deeply interested in topics of
Neuroscience, Cognitive Science and Philosophy. I believe that the link between the brain and AI is the thing that will shape the future of humanity.

I also love martial arts, especially karate, which I have been doing for 15 years. Martial arts play an important part in my life by teaching me discipline, courage, persistence, and humility. Besides that, I love reading books, playing guitar, and sharing my thoughts in my [blog on Telegram](https://t.me/abekek_notes).
