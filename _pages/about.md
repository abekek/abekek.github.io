Thank you for visiting my page! My name is Alibek Kaliyev, and I am an international student from Kazakhstan studying Computer Science and Business at Lehigh University.

Along with my passion for Machine/Deep Learning technologies and Software Engineering, I am deeply interested in topics related to Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and Philosophy. I believe that the link between the brain and AI is the thing that will shape the future of humanity.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid martial artist with 15 years of experience in karate. Martial arts have taught me discipline, courage, persistence, and humility, and they play an important part in my life. I also enjoy reading books, playing guitar, and sharing my thoughts in my [blog on Telegram](https://t.me/abekek_notes).
